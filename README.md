# Nitori's Toolkit

Sometimes I face some repititive work that really drives me MAD.  
So to avoid working by myself I sometimes code little programs to deal with these.  
These codes are somehow boring, but they're just my playground(?)  
The name Nitori comes from Kawashiro Nitori (河城にとり), a character in Touhou Project.
